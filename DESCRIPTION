Description: Response surface methods for drug synergy analysis. Available
    methods include generalized and classical Loewe formulations as well as Highest
    Single Agent methodology. Response surfaces can be plotted in an interactive
    3-D plot and formal statistical tests for presence of synergistic effects are
    available. Implemented methods and tests are described in the article 
    "BIGL: Biochemically Intuitive Generalized Loewe null model for prediction 
    of the expected combined effect compatible with partial agonism and antagonism"
